Optional: Provide additional description (beyond the PR title).
Description should provide any background or motivation needed for the change, as well
as a high-level overview of the approach taken (if the change is not straightforward).
Detailed rationale for specific sections of the code are probably better off as code comments
so that future readers of that code can benefit.
